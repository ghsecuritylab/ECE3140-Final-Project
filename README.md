## Snake Game

This project is an adaptation of the classic Snake arcade game, implemented using a 32x32 RGB LED matrix and an accelerometer. In this game, the snake moves around the grid with the objective of growing as long as it can without dying. The snake grows by obtaining “food,” which are randomly generated dots on the grid. The snake dies if it runs into any of its own body segments or into the boundaries of the board. We were successfully able to recreate this game on the 32x32 LED matrix, using the accelerometer on the FRDM-K64F board to control the snake’s direction.
